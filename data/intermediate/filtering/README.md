The `decontam` folder contains visualization files for screening contaminating features in the data.

The feature table `table-filtered.biom` was filtered to exclude: 
1) chloroplast/mitochondria sequences and those without a phylum-level taxonomic annotation; 
2) low-prevalence features that only present in one sample; 
3) contaminating features.
